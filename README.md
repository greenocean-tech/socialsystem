Labor can reply on this ai system instead of interface terrible leaders and reduce office bully situation.

* Manager can not state clear task to labor but push all the responsibility to labors then asked labor resign.
* Manager yelling labor at the office but without helping solve the issue.
* Manager asked labor privacy questions without respectful.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   task = ['report', 'repair', 'operation', 'quality', 'year']
   pop = [low wage, reject transfer, HR and leader comment, bully behavior, yell]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [correct, incorrect, wage, complete, incomplete]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(task)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (task[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
